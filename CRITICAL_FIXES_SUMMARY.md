# 🚨 Critical Bug Fixes & Dynamic Features

**🌐 Updated Application**: https://3000-i9us96luetzyr6dhv7ti9-6532622b.e2b.dev

## ✅ **Major Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Level Badge Calculation Bug** ✅
**Problem**: Level badge still showing "Rookie" despite course completions
**Root Cause**: Level calculation was using cached/stale data instead of real course completion status
**Solution**: 
- Updated `getUnifiedProgress()` to calculate level based on ACTUAL completed courses
- Level now recalculates in real-time when courses are completed
- Removed dependency on outdated cached level data

### 2. **Double Course Completion Bug** ✅
**Problem**: Completing one course was marking two courses as completed
**Root Cause**: Race condition between local UI updates and global progress tracking
**Solution**:
- Fixed course completion logic to prevent duplicate triggers
- Added proper completion status checking in course data fetching
- Implemented proper module completion status tracking

### 3. **Static Recent Achievements** ✅
**Problem**: Achievements were static demo data, not updating with real progress
**Solution**: Created comprehensive **Achievement System**:

#### **Dynamic Achievement Types**:
- **Course Completions**: "Completed [Course Name] • Earned XXX XP"
- **XP Milestones**: "Reached 1000 XP - Knowledge Seeker"
- **Level Ups**: "Leveled up to Veteran!"
- **Learning Streaks**: "Achieved 7-day learning streak"
- **Affiliate Income**: "Earned $150 in commissions" (demo data)

#### **Smart Achievement Logic**:
- Prevents duplicate achievements (within 1-minute window)
- Tracks achievement timestamps for "time ago" display
- Marks recent achievements as "NEW" (last 24 hours)
- Stores achievements in localStorage for persistence

### 4. **Progress Bar Percentage Bug** ✅
**Problem**: Progress percentage not updating properly
**Solution**:
- Fixed unified progress calculation to use actual course completion data
- Progress percentage now reflects real course completion status
- Synced across Dashboard, All Courses, and individual course pages

### 5. **Learning Streak Accuracy** ✅
**Problem**: Streak was static demo data (always 12 days)
**Solution**: Created **Real Streak Tracking System**:
- Tracks actual lesson completion dates
- Calculates consecutive day streaks accurately
- Handles streak breaks and resets properly
- Updates streak on every lesson completion
- Initializes with demo data for new users (5-day current, 12-day longest)

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **New Achievement System** (`/lib/services/achievementsService.ts`)
```typescript
// Automatic achievement triggers
await checkCourseCompletion(courseId, courseName);
await checkXPMilestone(currentXP);
await checkLevelUp(completedCourses);
await checkStreakAchievement(streakDays);
```

### **Real Streak Tracking** (`/lib/services/streakService.ts`)
```typescript
// Updates on lesson completion
updateStreakOnLessonComplete();

// Smart consecutive day detection
areConsecutiveDays(lastDate, today);
```

### **Unified Progress Service** (Enhanced)
- **Single Source of Truth**: All progress data flows through one service
- **Real-time Level Calculation**: Level updates immediately on course completion
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic cache refresh on progress changes
- **Performance Optimized**: Cached course data with intelligent invalidation
