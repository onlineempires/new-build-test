- **Persistent Checkboxes**: Task completion checkboxes remain sticky for 24 hours

- **Daily XP Limits**: XP cannot exceed the maximum possible for selected path

## DMO (Daily Method of Operation) System - ENHANCED SECURITY

### Daily Commitment Paths (ONE SELECTION ONLY)
1. **Express Path** - 1 Hour Per Day (6 tasks, 150 XP MAX)
2. **Pocket Builder** - 2 Hours Per Day (10 tasks, 300 XP MAX)
3. **Steady Climber** - 4 Hours Per Day (12 tasks, 500 XP MAX)

### Anti-Gaming Features

✅ **Single Completion Tracking**: Only one DMO completion counted per day  
✅ **Persistent Task State**: Checkboxes maintain state for full 24-hour period  
✅ **Visual Lock Indicators**: "Path Locked Until Midnight Reset" messaging  
✅ **Countdown Timer**: Shows exact time until daily reset occurs  
✅ **Commitment Enforcement**: "Choose your commitment level wisely" messaging

### DMO Security Logic
```typescript
// Path selection is permanent for the day
const selectPath = (pathId: string) => {
  if (hasPathSelected) return; // Prevents path changes
  // Selection logic with localStorage persistence
};

// XP validation prevents gaming
const validateDailyXP = (currentXP: number, pathId: string): number => {
  const path = DMO_PATHS.find(p => p.id === pathId);
  return Math.min(currentXP, path.totalXP); // Caps at path maximum
};

// Stats only update once per day
if (allTasksCompleted && stats.lastCompletedDate !== today) {
  // Update stats logic with date validation
}
```
