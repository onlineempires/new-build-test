# Lesson Visibility Fix for Dark Themes

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved
Fixed critical visibility issue where lesson items in dark themes (Skool Dark, Neon/Tech, Dark Mode) were barely visible by default and only showed up clearly when hovered over.

## ðŸ”§ Changes Made

### Lesson List Visibility Fixes
- **Replaced hardcoded colors** with theme-aware classes throughout course detail pages
- **Text colors**: Changed `text-gray-900`, `text-gray-500` â†’ `theme-text-primary`, `theme-text-secondary`, `theme-text-muted`
- **Hover states**: Changed `hover:bg-gray-50` â†’ `theme-hover` for proper dark theme support
- **Icons**: Updated play/lock icons to use `theme-text-muted` instead of `text-gray-400`

### Course Progress Section
- Fixed course progress text colors to use theme classes
- Updated statistics (completed lessons, total modules, estimated time) for better contrast

### Continue Learning Section  
- Changed `bg-blue-50`, `text-blue-900` â†’ `theme-bg-secondary`, `theme-text-primary`
- Ensures section is visible in all themes

### Quick Actions Buttons
- Updated button styling to use `theme-border`, `theme-text-secondary`, `theme-hover`
