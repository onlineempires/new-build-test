## üìß How Email Confirmation Works

When a user completes a booking through the Expert Directory, the system automatically sends two emails:

- **Subject**: "Coaching Session Confirmed with [Expert Name] - [Date]"
- **Content**: 
  - Expert details with photo
  - Session date, time, and duration
  - Booking ID for reference
  - Meeting link placeholder
  - What to expect information
  - Rescheduling policy

### 2. **Payment Receipt Email**
- **Subject**: "Payment Receipt - Coaching Session with [Expert Name]"  
- **Content**:
  - Transaction details with timestamp
  - Payment amount and status
  - Revenue distribution (Expert/Platform/Affiliate)

  - Record keeping instructions
